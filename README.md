For the node_modules_Git zip file, you might need to unpackage it for the code to work as it will wonder where the dependenices for Express JS are, 
which theyre are in that ZIP file.

This was done due to the fact that Express JS downloaded over 1000 files for said dependencies and GitHub doesnt like to upload that much at once.

Nothing should affect it after that.
